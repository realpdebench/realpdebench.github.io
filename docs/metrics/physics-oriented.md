# Physics-oriented Metrics

These metrics evaluate whether predictions respect **physical structure** such as spectral content, frequencies, energy, and long-time statistics.

## fRMSE (Fourier Space Error)

Measures error in the frequency domain, capturing spectral accuracy.

## FE (Frequency Error)

Evaluates temporal periodicity and vortex shedding frequency.

## KE (Kinetic Energy Error)

$$
\text{KE} = |e - \hat{e}|, \quad e = \frac{(u')^2 + (v')^2}{2}
$$

Assesses energy conservation in velocity fields.

## MVPE (Mean Velocity Profile Error)

Compares long-term time-averaged velocity profiles against theoretical distributions.
