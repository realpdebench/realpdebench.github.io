# Foundation Models

Foundation models in RealPDEBench refer to large-scale pretrained models that can be adapted to operator-learning tasks.

## DPOT (Diffusion Pre-trained Operator Transformer)

**DPOT** is a diffusion-based foundation model for operator learning, pretrained on diverse PDE datasets.

### DPOT-L

- **Parameters**: 509M

### DPOT-S

- **Parameters**: 30M

## Notes

- We report both large and small variants to study scaling behavior vs. efficiency.
